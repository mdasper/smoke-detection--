🚀 Smoke Detection using YOLOv8 and Gradio

📌 Project Overview
This project implements a real-time smoke detection system using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model. The model can detect smoke in images and highlight affected areas, making it useful for fire prevention, environmental monitoring, and safety applications.

The application is built with Gradio, providing an interactive web-based interface where users can upload images and receive real-time smoke detection results.

📂 Features
✅ Pre-trained YOLOv8 model for efficient smoke detection
✅ Interactive web UI using Gradio
✅ Real-time processing of uploaded images
✅ Customizable thresholds for confidence and IoU
✅ Easy to deploy and use

📊 Model Details
The project uses kittendev/YOLOv8m-smoke-detection, a pre-trained YOLOv8 Medium model optimized for smoke detection tasks. It operates with:

Confidence threshold: 0.25
IoU threshold: 0.45
Max detections: 1000
🏆 Results
The model effectively highlights smoke in images and provides real-time feedback via the Gradio interface.
